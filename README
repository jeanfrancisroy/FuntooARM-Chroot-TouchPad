Funtoo ARM Chroot for the HP TouchPad
=========================================

This package will install Funtoo ARM to a chroot ext3fs,
just like ArchLinux Chroot, that is just like the Ubuntu 11.04 
chroot. In fact, this is going to be basically a copy-paste of
a copy-paste operation, so take a look at 
https://github.com/crimsonredmk/ArchLinuxARM-Chroot-TouchPad and 
http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/UbuntuChroot and
search around the internets.

Building the IPK
================
- Move org.funtoo.funtoo-chroot into a folder, usr/palm/applications/
  - this is the IPK's "data"

TODO
====
- Add line in pmPostInstall to check if ext3fs is mounted before extracting
- Make the entire Debian IPK structure
- Something about upstart scripts?
- What do we need for Xserver to hook into ArchLinux ARM?
