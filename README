Arch Linux ARM Chroot for the HP TouchPad
=========================================

This package will install Arch Linux ARMto a chroot ext3fs,
just like the Ubuntu 11.04 chroot. In fact, this is
going to be basically a copy-paste operation, so take a look
at http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/UbuntuChroot and
search around the internets.

TODO
====
- Make a new app icon
- Make a new rootfs tgz, including any webos modifications.
  - e.g. /home/webos
