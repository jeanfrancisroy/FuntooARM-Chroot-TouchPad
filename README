Arch Linux ARM Chroot for the HP TouchPad
=========================================

This package will install Arch Linux ARMto a chroot ext3fs,
just like the Ubuntu 11.04 chroot. In fact, this is
going to be basically a copy-paste operation, so take a look
at http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/UbuntuChroot and
search around the internets.

Building the IPK
================
- Move org.crimsonredmk.alarm-chroot into a folder, usr/palm/applications/
  - this is the IPK's "data"

TODO
====
- Make a new rootfs tgz, including any webos modifications.
  - e.g. /home/webos
- Make the entire Debian IPK structure
